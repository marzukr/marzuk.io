          In just a few days, I crafted an app that visually guides you to the
          decision your intuition is leaning towards. By interacting with your
          options, intuition.fyi elegantly reveals your true preference. Whether
          it's picking a restaurant or deciding on weekend plans, this tool
          helps you make decisions that just <span class="italic">feel
          right.</span>

          I first got into playing poker in 2019. Shortly after learning the
          basic game theory and probabilities behind a winning strategy, I
          thought <span class="italic">this seems like something a computer
          could do better than me.</span> So, I set out to learn all about the
          best poker AIs and build one of my own. After two years of work in my
          free time, I had built an AI that could beat my friends.

          In high school I built and led a club that addressed digital waste and
          access. We collected used electronic devices from around our
          neighborhood, repaired them, and delivered them to new homes. During
          my time there, more than 100 students volunteered with us. Together we
          repaired and donated more than $100,000 of electronics. Today, the
          club is in the hands of new student leadership and is doing better
          than ever.
