        I am a builder. From legos to 2x4s to code, I will build with
        anything.
      </p>
      <p class="font-serif mt-2">
        Until recently, I was mostly building for myself. But it's been
        a long-standing goal of mine to build something that's useful
        to others.
      <p class="font-serif mt-2">
        In July of 2022, I left my 9-5 job as a software engineer to
        pursue this goal full-time. I'm documenting my journey along the
        way.
